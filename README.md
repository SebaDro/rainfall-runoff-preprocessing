# Rainfall Runoff Preprocessing
## Description
This repository provides some basic data preprocessing routines related to
rainfall runoff modelling. Preprocessing functions are implemented in R and aim
to prepare rainfall and discharge timeseries data as well as catchment datasets
for machine learning based modelling.
## Get started
The project comes with a an R Markdown file as well as with a Jupyter Notebook
that guides you through the different processing steps. Using R Markdown, required
libraries will be installed as part of the code execution. If you'd rather inspect the
preprocessing workflow using Jupyter Notebooks, the projects provides an `environment.yml`
which lists all required libraries and can be used to install these as Anaconda packages.
